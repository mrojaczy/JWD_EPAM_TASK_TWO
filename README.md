# Task Two

### In the very task we have to implement several methods: find the product with the lowest price and find all the teapots in our db

### I choose a pattern called "Factory method" that is creating an instance of class that I need

### db package is a package for db file and classes that are processing the information in my db

### factory package is a package for classes connected with models.classes and create the instance of a such class

### models package is a package for classes which describe the product and all their characteristics

#### I do not create teapots, because my program can find out that there aren't any teapot in the db. But I have to create price, because I need to compare product by the common parameter...
